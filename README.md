# ClarinetNet
This project was done for my bachelor thesis project in 2025. It features a clarinet specific dataset that can be used for training AI models that focus on Automatic Music Transcription (AMT). This study was done as a pilot study so as to proof a concept of the feasibility of single-instrument datasets outperforming multi-instrument datasets.
